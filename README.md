# MVC Tech Blog

## Description

Welcome to our MVC technology blog, built using ExpressJS and Node!

Our blog follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, a widely-used design pattern in web development that separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (logic).

We use ExpressJS, a powerful and flexible Node.js web application framework, to handle the server-side logic and HTTP requests. ExpressJS allows us to easily route requests, handle middleware, and render dynamic HTML pages.
